# Space-Invaders
Q2

A Space Invader styled game that includes a spaceship and a collection of aliens who move towards the player. Difficulty can be set by the player, and aliens accelerate speed as the score increases.

The player must dodge the aliens while shooting them to obtain the highest score possible. Movement is cursor-based and the player can shoot by clicking.

Changelogs:

Version 1: Includes a collection of looping aliens and a mouse-controlled player. Also contains a difficulty menu and incrementing speed as the score progresses.
